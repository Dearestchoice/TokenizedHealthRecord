## Tokenized Health Records

The Tokenized Health Records project is a decentralized, privacy-preserving system for managing and sharing health data on the blockchain. By leveraging tokenization and access control, patients gain full ownership over their health records, with the ability to selectively share data with healthcare providers in a secure, permissioned manner.

## Project Overview

The Tokenized Health Records project aims to:
- Enable patients to securely store their health records on the blockchain.
- Allow patients to manage access to their data through token-based permissions.
- Provide privacy-preserving data sharing, allowing only relevant information to be shared without exposing the entire health record.

## Key Features
1. **Encrypted, On-Chain Health Records**: Health records are encrypted before being stored on-chain, ensuring only authorized individuals can access them.
2. **Access Control via Token Permissions**: Patients can control access by granting temporary access tokens to healthcare providers.
3. **Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing**: Patients can selectively share specific parts of their health records using privacy-preserving methods.
4. **Data Retrieval and Automatic Access Revocation**: Healthcare providers with valid access can retrieve data until the access period expires, after which access is revoked automatically.

## How it Works

1. **Tokenization of Records**: Health records are encrypted off-chain and stored on the blockchain as tokens.
2. **Access Management**: Patients have full control over access permissions and can grant time-limited tokens to healthcare providers.
3. **Data Retrieval**: Authorized providers can retrieve and decrypt health data with patient consent.
4. **Data Sharing**: Patients can share specific parts of their health records, enabling privacy-preserving data exchange in healthcare.

## Goals

- **Enhance Patient Autonomy**: Patients manage and control access to their health data.
- **Increase Data Privacy**: Sensitive health information is protected through encryption and token-based access.
- **Support Secure Data Sharing**: Facilitate private, controlled sharing of health records with healthcare providers.
- **Enable Regulatory Compliance**: Create an immutable history of data access and modifications for compliance needs.

## Future Improvements

1. **Integration with Off-Chain Storage**: Use IPFS or other decentralized storage solutions for storing larger files.
2. **Automated Audit Logging**: Track access and modifications to ensure compliance with healthcare regulations.
